### Are you able to produce any errors or unexpected results?
I got the following error when trying to remove an item from the shopping list:
TypeError: Cannot set property 'cartCount' of undefined

### Were there any parts of the interface that you found confusing or unclear?
As mentioned in the project description, displaying the array as-is for the shopping list is less ideal than a true list of items. 

The grains page was a bit confusing as a user. I would expect to be able to click on the list to get recipes that use each of the grains.

I would also expect the featured recipe to be clickable.

### Are there aspects of the code that you feel were not self-evident and would benefit from comments?
There were still some naming conventions that seemed like leftovers from the online store concept (eg. productId and cartId). It would have been nice to make that more clear through comments and naming conventions.

### Are there any parts of the code that you found interesting or taught you something new?
For my recipe site, I had users add individual ingredients to their shopping list, but seeing you project made me realize how convenient it was to add them all at once. It might be nice to allow for both (in case a user already has some of the ingredients in their pantry / fridge.

### Are there any best practices discussed in course material that you feel were not addressed in the code?
Overall, I think this was a very good implementation of what we covered in our course. I think a little bit of polish on the naming conventions of methods and variables would make it easier to follow, but that's nit picky.

### Do you have any additional comments not covered in the above questions?
Might be nice to add a custom or blank favicon
