## Notes for instructor
*My company has been talking about revising our recipe section of our website for some time. Even though I'm not a software engineer there, I thought this would be a neat way to get my hands dirty and mock-up what new functionality could look like. I'm excited to add more to the mock-up after the course is over!*
