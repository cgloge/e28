# Project 2
+ By: Carly Gloge

## Outside resources
None

## Notes for instructor
* I decided to make the countdown clock the main component since that felt like a re-usable object for other games
* I could have made each of the buttons in a grid their own component, but didn't see much value in creating a container beyond the button object itself that doesn't provide much functionality. I'll consider this for future projects if I want to add new functionality.
